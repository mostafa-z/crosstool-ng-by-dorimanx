# GLIBC and kernel are special when it comes to obsoletion. Users
# of crosstool-ng depend on the ability to build new toolchains matching
# the kernel/libc versions of a particular target system, and LTS releases
# are still using quite ancient versions. Please do not retire versions
# (including versions in between) until the EOL dates indicated in version.desc.
