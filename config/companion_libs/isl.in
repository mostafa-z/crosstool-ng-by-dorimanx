# ISL options

# TBD need to encode this with new framework
# GCC 4.8 supports ISL 0.10 to 0.14
# GCC 4.9 supports ISL 0.10 to 0.15
# GCC 5   supports ISL 0.12 to 0.16
# GCC 6   supports ISL 0.14 to 0.16
# GCC 7   supports ISL 0.15 and up
# Starting with GCC 5, GCC's configure no longer checks the ISL version explicitly,
# despite what the configure's message says ("checking for isl 0.15 or 0.16").
# Instead, it verifies that certain interfaces are available, so it accepts 0.17.1
# or 0.18 under that check. Include them as experimental just in case anyone needs
# the bugfixes in these releases.
