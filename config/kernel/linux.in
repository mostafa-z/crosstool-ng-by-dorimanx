## help Build a toolchain targeting systems running Linux as a kernel.

# GLIBC and kernel are special when it comes to obsoletion. Users
# of crosstool-ng depend on the ability to build new toolchains matching
# the kernel/libc versions of a particular target system, and LTS releases
# are still using quite ancient versions. Please do not retire versions
# (including versions in between) until the EOL dates indicated below.
# Such pinned versions are indicated in version.desc files with a comment.
